            <h2>Serving</h2>
            
            <p>Mastering your serve can give you a significant advantage. Here’s how to refine your serving technique:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grip:</strong> Use the Continental grip to enable better control and spin. Hold the racket as if you are shaking hands with it.</li>
                <li><strong>Stance:</strong> Position your feet shoulder-width apart with your front foot slightly forward. Balance your weight evenly.</li>
                <li><strong>Toss:</strong> Toss the ball slightly in front of you and high enough to allow a full extension of your arm during the serve.</li>
                <li><strong>Motion:</strong> Rotate your shoulders and hips as you swing. Aim to make contact with the ball at its peak and follow through smoothly.</li>
                <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Aim for various spots in the service box to keep your opponent guessing. Practice serving to different areas for greater accuracy.</li>

            <h2>Positioning</h2>
            
            <p>Effective positioning on the court can greatly enhance your performance. Follow these tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Baseline Position:</strong> Stay a few feet behind the baseline to give yourself enough time to react to the ball. Be ready to move forward or backward as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Net Position:</strong> When approaching the net, position yourself closer to it and stay low. Be prepared to react quickly to volleys and passing shots.</li>
                <li><strong>Side-to-Side Movement:</strong> Use quick side steps to cover the width of the court. Position yourself to intercept the ball early and reduce your opponent’s options.</li>
                <li><strong>Anticipation:</strong> Read your opponent’s body language and shot selection to anticipate their next move. Position yourself accordingly to gain the upper hand.</li>
