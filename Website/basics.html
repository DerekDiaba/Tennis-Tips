        <h1>Basic Tennis Tips</h1>
        <p>Tennis is a dynamic and exciting sport that requires mastering several fundamental skills. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide to help you get started with the basic strokes, grips, and footwork.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Basic Strokes</h2> 
            <p>Strokes are the foundation of your tennis game. Here are the primary strokes you'll need to master:</p>

            <h3>Forehand</h3>
            
            <p>The forehand stroke is typically used when the ball comes to your dominant side. To execute a forehand:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grip:</strong> Use the Eastern or Semi-Western grip for better control and spin.</li>
                <li><strong>Stance:</strong> Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with your non-dominant foot slightly ahead.</li>
                <li><strong>Swing:</strong> Rotate your hips and shoulders as you swing your racquet forward, making contact with the ball in front of your body.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Backhand</h3>
            
            <p>The backhand is used when the ball comes to your non-dominant side. There are two types of backhands:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Two-Handed Backhand:</strong> Use both hands to grip the racquet, which provides extra power and control. Swing with both arms extending towards the ball.</li>
                <li><strong>One-Handed Backhand:</strong> Grip the racquet with one hand for a more classic approach. This requires more strength and technique but offers greater reach and precision.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Serve</h3>
            
            <p>The serve is the starting stroke for each point and is crucial for setting up the rest of the rally:</p>
            
                <li><strong>Grip:</strong> Use the Continental grip for versatility in serving.</li>
                <li><strong>Stance:</strong> Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your weight on your back foot.</li>
                <li><strong>Swing:</strong> Toss the ball slightly in front of you and above your head. Swing your racquet up and over, aiming to strike the ball at its highest point.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Volley</h3>
            
            <p>The volley is used when you are close to the net and need to intercept the ball before it bounces:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grip:</strong> Use the Continental grip to handle both forehand and backhand volleys.</li>
                <li><strong>Stance:</strong> Keep your feet close together and be ready to move quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Swing:</strong> Use a short, compact swing, focusing on timing and placement rather than power.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Basic Grips</h2>
            <p>The grip you use affects your control and power. Here are the main types of grips:</p>

            <h3>Eastern Grip</h3>
           
            <p>This grip is commonly used for forehand strokes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hold the racquet with the base knuckle of your index finger on the third bevel of the racquet handle.</li>
                <li>This grip offers good control and is easy to learn for beginners.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Western Grip</h3>
            
            <p>The Western grip is used for generating topspin:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the base knuckle of your index finger on the fourth bevel of the handle.</li>
                <li>This grip allows you to hit with a heavy topspin but may be more challenging to master.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Continental Grip</h3>
            
            <p>The Continental grip is versatile and used for serving, volleying, and some groundstrokes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hold the racquet as if you were shaking hands with it. The base knuckle of your index finger should be on the second bevel.</li>
                <li>This grip is ideal for serves and volleys but less effective for topspin shots.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Two-Handed Grip</h3>
            
            <p>This grip is commonly used for the backhand stroke:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Place your dominant hand in the Eastern grip and your non-dominant hand in the Continental grip.</li>
                <li>This grip offers more power and control for backhand strokes.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Basic Footwork</h2>
            <p>Good footwork is crucial for positioning and balance. Here are some essential footwork techniques:</p>

            <h3>Ready Position</h3>
            
            <p>Start in the ready position to be prepared for any shot:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and your weight on the balls of your feet.</li>
                <li>Hold your racquet up and in front of you, with both hands ready to move quickly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Split Step</h3>
           
            <p>The split step helps you transition from one side of the court to the other:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As your opponent hits the ball, perform a small jump, landing with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.</li>
                <li>This prepares you to move in any direction quickly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Forehand and Backhand Side Steps</h3>
          
            <p>Use side steps to position yourself for forehand and backhand shots:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For a forehand side step, push off your back foot and move laterally to your dominant side.</li>
                <li>For a backhand side step, push off your front foot and move laterally to your non-dominant side.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Forward and Backward Movement</h3>
          
            <p>Move forward or backward to adjust your position on the court:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To move forward, push off your back foot and use short, quick steps.</li>
                <li>To move backward, push off your front foot and use longer strides to maintain balance.</li>
            </ul>
